# @nuxstep/nativescript-spotify

> IMPORTANT: This project is in early development

## About

This project surged from our own needs, as there's no Spotify plugin available for NativeScript (or at least updated).

For now, the goal of this plugin is simple: Integrate Spotify into your app through the Spotify App Remote SDK, so you can control playback and get the user recommended content items.

Later (maybe), we can implement the Spotify Authentication SDK and Web API for more features, but that will depend on our available time and needs, so, feel free to help the project through issue submissions and pull requests.

## Usage

Not available on npm yet, but soon you'll be able to add to your project with:

```bash
ns plugin add @nuxstep/nativescript-spotify
```

If you want to test it in your app, refer to the demo (`apps/demo`) on how to include the plugin manually and how to use it.
